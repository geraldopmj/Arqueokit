# Arqueokit

[English](README.md) | [Português (Brasil)](README.pt-BR.md)

Archeokit is a plugin designed to streamline the analysis and processing of geospatial data for archaeology.

### Features:
- Download layers commonly used  
✅ Download layers from IPHAN’s GeoServer  
✅ Download layers from FUNAI's GeoServer  
- Geoprocessing faster grids  
✅ Analyze and create point grids that maximize the number of points inside a polygon (useful for surveying)  
✅ Create radial point grids from points (common method for archaeological site delimitation in Brazil)  
- Faster Bivariate maps  
✅ Generate a bivariate raster from two rasters  
✅ Generate a bivariate RGB raster, already symbolized, and provide a PNG legend ready for maps  
- Charts without leaving QGIS  
✅ Create a burndown chart based on a date attribute (useful for team coordination during surveying)  
✅ Create a Count Unique graph for a single attribute (used during LULC sampling to maintain sample balance)  
✅ Create a Comparison graph (Sum or Mean) across 2 to 5 attributes (e.g., compare which stratum has more artifacts)  
✅ Create a bar chart showing the sum of up to 5 numeric attributes grouped (sum) by feature  
- Ordering and updating Attribute Table  
✅ Create an attribute ordering point layer (NW → SE)  
✅ Generate Latitude and Longitude attributes directly in the attribute table (in-place update)  
✅ Generate all attributes for archaeological survey forms (Ficha Arqueológica) automatically, including id, Name, coordinates, and default fields

-- Looking forward to add many more scripts

## How to install
### External dependencies
QGIS already comes with several built-in Python libraries, but some used by the plugin must be installed manually, as they are not included in the standard QGIS Python environment. You must install the following external libraries via `pip` (using the **OSGeo4W Shell**):

    pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn rasterio shapely pillow requests

### **What each library is for:**

-   **pandas** → attribute table manipulation (DataFrames)
-   **matplotlib** → graph generation
-   **seaborn** → enhanced and styled graphs
-   **rasterio** → reading and writing raster data
-   **shapely** → advanced geometric operations for vector data
-   **pillow (PIL)** → image processing (e.g., creation of PNG legends)
-   **requests** → connecting with external services (e.g., downloading data)

### **Download and install the package in QGIS**

1.  **Download the plugin (.zip)**
    -   Click the green **Code** button (at the top-right of the file list in [this page](https://github.com/geraldopmj/Arqueokit/tree/main)).
    -   Select **Download ZIP**.
    -   The file will be downloaded to your computer.
    -   Extract the contents of the ZIP file.
    -   Rename the extracted folder from Arqueokit-main to Arqueokit (the name must match the plugin name exactly).
    -   ZIP the renamed folder (QGIS only accept .zip files).
   
2.  **Open QGIS**
    -   Go to **Plugins → Manage and Install Plugins…**
    -   Click on **Install from ZIP** (button in the bottom-left corner).
        
3.  **Install the plugin**
    -   Locate the `.zip` file.
    -   Click **Install Plugin**.
    -   QGIS will automatically install the plugin.
        
4.  **Activate the plugin**
    -   After installation, check if the plugin is enabled in the list of installed plugins.
    -   It will be available in the **Processing Toolbox**.
        
> ⚠️ **Note:** If you are updating from a previous version, it is recommended to remove it first to avoid conflicts.
